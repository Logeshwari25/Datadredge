            <div>Mitt Romney's Re-Invention As Anti-Poverty Warrior
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <div>With the shake of an Etch-A-Sketch, Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the Republican Party on Friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality. One only wonders why the former governor of Massachusetts neglected to focus on the growing problems the last time he held the title of GOP standard bearer.</div>

        <div class="info">
            <div>Iâ€™m not sure when it started, but at some point the Republican Party ceded the business of governance to the Democrats. Maybe it began with the Tea Party movement or Fox News or the larger conservative media-industrial complex â€“ I honestly donâ€™t know. But itâ€™s clear now that the GOP is no longer a legitimate governing party.</div>
